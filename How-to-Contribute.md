Contributing to the WordPress for iOS App is pretty easy. All code into the app comes in via pull requests attached to a specific issue. If your addition to the project is for an already existing [issue](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/issues) then submit a pull request and make sure to mention that issue in your pull request. If your addition isn't for an already existing issue, then go ahead and create an issue and then make sure to mention that newly created issue in your pull request.

### Specifics of the Pull Request
The team roughly follows this [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). All bug fixes and new feature work is done using new branches that are merged into `develop` using pull requests. The branch name should correspond to the issue number if the code is related to a bug fix and include a description. For example, if the issue number was 1000 and the issue was related to an editor crash, an appropriate branch name would be `issue/1000-editor-crash`.  If your code is related to a new feature, then use the following branch naming style `feature/feature-name-here`. 

As you commit code to these branches, don't tag the issue number in the individual commit messages as it pollutes the pull request and makes it messier, just attach the issue number to the final pull request. Before you submit your final pull request, make sure all your branch is up to date with develop.
